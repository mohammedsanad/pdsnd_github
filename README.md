# pdsnd_github
GitHub project (Project 3) repository for PDSND

In this project, you will make use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. You will write code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. You will also write a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics

Python Script to Explore US Bikeshare Data
This Python script is written for Project 2 (Term 1) of Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree (DAND) and is used to explore data related to bike share systems for Chicago, New York City, and Washington. It imports data from csv files and compute descriptive statistics from the data. It also takes in users' raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

How to run the script
You can run the script using a Python integrated development environment (IDE) such as Spyder. To install Spyder, you will need to download the Anaconda installer. This script is written in Python 3, so you will need the Python 3.x version of the installer. After downloading and installing Anaconda, you will find the Spyder IDE by opening Anaconda Navigator.

Datasets
The datasets used for this script contain bike share data for the first six months of 2017. Some data wrangling has been performed by Udacity's staff before being provided to the students of DAND. Under the permission of Udacity, I have uploaded a copy of the datasets here. The file sizes are too big to be uploaded on GitHub, so they were uploaded on Google Drive instead. After downloading the datasets, place them in the same folder with this Python script.
