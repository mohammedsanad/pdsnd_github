Project Title
Explore U.S. Bikeshare Data Python Script

Description
This project involves writing a Python script for the "Introduction to Python" segment of the Programming for Data Science Nanodegree Program. The Python script is used to analyze raw data collected in 2017 from bike-share systems in the cities Chicago, New York City, and Washington D.C. The Python script answers questions related to bike-share usage by computing a variety of descriptive statistics. The script imports the raw data and presents interactive input fields to the user within the terminal, so that user can choose to view statistics by city, month, and/or day of the week.

Files used
The raw data files used in this project are:

bikeshare_AzimKhan.py
chicago.csv
new_york_city.csv
